    "description": "Taxonomic analysis is used to extract taxonomy (taxonomic composition) of\nthe samples. It achieves this by using a ML model for this process.\n\nThe info that gets extracted is also visualized, so you\ncan easily explore multiple levels of taxonomic composition of the samples.\n\nInput data is:\n    - File which contains metadata about samples\n    - ML model which predicts taxonomic composition of a\n      given sequence\n    - Filtered sequence data generated by the third job in the Coretex\n      Qiime pipeline, DADA2\n\nOutput data is the taxonomic composition of the provided samples.",
