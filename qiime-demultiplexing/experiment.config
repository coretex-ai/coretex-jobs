    "description": "Multiple samples can be pooled into a single sequencing run. This reduces the time and\ncost of sequencing. To differentiate between these samples, each of them had a unique\nbarcode injected into them before sequencing them.\n\nBefore doing any kind of analysis on sequence data, you first need to extract\nthe sample data from sequences associated with every of the barcodes. This template\nis used for doing that.\n\nThe input is a dataset which contains miltiplexed sequences imported to Qiime2\nwith the EMP Protoacol. This can be done using the Import job form the Coretex\nQiime templates\n\nOutput data is demultiplexed sequences which contains a separate \"fastq\" file\nfor every sample.",
