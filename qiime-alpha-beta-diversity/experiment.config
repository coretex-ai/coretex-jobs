    "description": "Downstream analysis provides most information about the sequences.\nThere are two kinds of downstream analysis:\n    - Alpha diversity\n    - Beta diversity\n\nAlpha diversity provides a detailed information about which bacteria are contained inside a single sample.\nBeta diversity provides a detailed information about regional and local diversity between samples.\n\nInput data is:\n    - File which contains metadata about samples\n    - Filtered sequence data generated by the second job in\n      the Coretex Qiime pipeline, DADA2\n    - Rooted sequence tree generated by the sixth job in the\n      Coretex Qiime pipeline, Phylogenetic Diversity Analysis\n\nOutput data is:\n    - Shannon’s diversity index - quantitative measure of community richness\n    - Observed Features - qualitative measure of community richness\n    - Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity  - qualitative measure of community\n      richness that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features\n    - Evenness (Pielou’s Evenness) - measure of community evenness\n    - Jaccard distance - qualitative measure of community dissimilarity\n    - Bray-Curtis distance - quantitative measure of community dissimilarity\n    - unweighted UniFrac distance - qualitative measure of community\n      dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features\n    - weighted UniFrac distance - quantitative measure of community dissimilarity\n      that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features",
