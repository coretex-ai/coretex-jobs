--- Template description ---

Bodysite Classifier - LSPIN project template uses a neural network architecture
based on the paper "Locally Sparse Neural Networks for Tabular Biomedical Data”,
which is a multilayer perceptron with gating layers.

This template takes BioInformatics sequence taxonomic compositions
and traines a model which is capable of predicting body site (from which the
sample originates) based on the sample taxonomic composition.

Data provided to the model can be in either of these two formats:
    - MBA (Microbe Atlas)
    - ForBiome (Forensics Microbiome Database, maintained by Microbiome Forensics Institute Zurich)

Input of the model is a 2D matrix with input shape [samples, uniqueTaxons] where:
samples: number of samples in the dataset
uniqueTaxons: number of unique taxons in the dataset

Output of the model is a 1D array with integers representing different bodysites.

Expected TaskRun runtime on GPU with 1GB of MBA data is ~30 minutes.

System specifications on which the TaskRuns were run:
    - CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X Eight-Core Processor
    - GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 12 GB VRAM
    - RAM: 32 GB 2666 MHz DDR4

TaskRun parameters:
Batch size: 512
Buffer size: 512
HIdden layers: [256, 256, 128]
Activation function: tanh
Batch norm: False
Cache: False
Enviromnment: Clean

--- Template parameters description ---

--- dataset description ---
A dataset which contains OTU abundance data. Supported dataset formats are:
    - MBA (Microbe Atlas): Dataset must contain one Coretex.ai sample
      with "samples.env.info" file, and one or more Coretex.ai samples
      which contain a single ".mapped" file (file with ".mapped" extension)
    - ForBiome (Forensics Microbiome Database, maintained by Microbiome Forensics
      Institute Zurich): Dataset must contain BioInformatics samples in json
      format as defined by "Microbiome Forensics Institute Zurich". Coretex.ai
      sample must contain only a single json file which contains data for a
      single BioInformatics sample.
---------------------------

--- validation description ---
Defines if TaskRun will be executed in training or validation mode.
If the value is set to false (unchecked) training mode will run,
and if the value is set to true (checked) then validation mode will be run.

If training mode is selected following parameters must be provided:
    - dataset
    - validation (value: false)
    - datasetType
    - taxonomicLevel
    - sampleOrigin
    - sequencingTechnique
    - batchSize
    - bufferSize
    - hiddenLayers
    - learningRate
    - lambda
    - activationFunction
    - epochs
    - displayStep
    - validationSplit
    - batchNorm
    - randomSeed
    - cache

If validation mode is selected following parameters must be provided:
    - dataset
    - validation (value: true)
    - trainedModel
    - datasetType
    - taxonomicLevel
    - sampleOrigin
    - quantize
    - sequencingTechnique
    - batchSize
    - cache
------------------------------

--- trainedModel description ---
Id of the model on which the validation will run.
If validation mode is selected this parameter must be provided,
and if training mode is selected this parameter will be ignored.
--------------------------------

--- datasetType description ---
Type of the provided dataset. Possible values are:
    - MBA (Microbe Atlas)
    - ForBiome (Microbiome Forensics Institute Zurich)

For more details see "dataset" parameter.
-------------------------------

--- taxonomicLevel description ---
Taxonomic level used for creating OTU (feature) tables used as
the input of the model. Expected value is a non-negative integer.

Expected values for taxon "B16S;90_3084;96_8430;97_10076":
    - Level 1: "B16S"
    - Level 2: "B16S;90_3084"
    - Level 3: "B16S;90_3084;96_8430"
----------------------------------

--- sampleOrigin description ---
Information on where sample originates from, the environment from
which the sample was collected from.

Example values are: animal, plant, aquatic, human, soil, field, etc.
--------------------------------

--- sequencingTechnique description ---
Sample sequencing techniques which were used to seqeuence the samples.
Possible values are:
    - AMPLICON
    - SHOTGUN
    - WGS

If value is set to "AMPLICON" then all samples which were sequenced using
that method will be used for further processing.
---------------------------------------

--- batchSize description ---
The model will be trained on data in batches rather then all at once.
This parameter dictates the numner of samples that will be in one batch.
------------------------------

--- bufferSize description ---
The model will place samples in a buffer of limited capacity (usualy less
then the total number of samples), and then randomly choose the next samples
to train on from that buffer, new samples replacing the chosen ones.
(a higher value can impove accuracy, but makes the shuffling take more time)
------------------------------

--- hiddenLayers description ---
A list in which each integer represents the number of nodes in that hidden layer.
The number of hidden layers depends on the number of elements in the list
(a larger model can learn a more complex representation of the training data,
thereby possibly increasing accuracy, but is more prone to overfit
and needs longer to train)
--------------------------------

--- learningRate description ---
Learning rate of the gradiend boosting algorithm. Prefered range of values
is 10^-6 (0,000001) - 1.0. Higher learning rates allow model to train faster,
but at the cost of final model accuracy. Lower learning rates make
model train significantly slower, but in a more optimal manner.
--------------------------------

--- lambda description ---
The L0 regularization parameter
(a higher value can reduce overfitting, but risks weakening the model)
--------------------------

--- activationFunction ---
The activation function used in the hidden layers of the prediction network.
The result of each nodes calculation will be passed through this function.

Possible functions:
    - "relu" (only positive tensors pass, negative tensors become 0),
    - "tanh" (tensors get squished between -1 and 1),
    - "sigmoid" (tensors get squished between 0 and 1),
    - "linear" (no actiavtion, i.e. x = x, hidden layers have no effect with this function)
--------------------------

--- epochs description ---
Number of passes that the model will make through the dataset while
training. Higher values increase training time and accuracy, while lower
values decrease training time, but they might also decrease accuracy.
--------------------------

--- displayStep ---
This integer will dictate how often training progress is printed.
It will print progress every n epochs, e.g. if 5 the metrics will
be displayed on epochs 5, 10, 15...
-------------------

--- validationSplit description ---
Percentage of dataset which will be used for validation. Prefered value range is
0.1 - 0.9, while the optimal value is 0.2. If values are close or equal to 0, or
close or equal to 1 unexpected errors can appear.

If value for "validationSplit" is 0.2, then that means that 20% of the dataset
will go for validation, while the rest (80%) will go for training.
-----------------------------------

--- batchNorm ---
Wheather to use batch normalization (batch norm) between the prediction layers.
Batch normalization applies a transformation that maintains the mean output
close to 0 and the output standard deviation close to 1 (depending on the data
this could imporve training performance, make training faster and slightly
reduce overfitting)
-----------------

--- randomSeed ---
The seed that will be used for random processes such as parameter initialization
and shuffling between epochs (this allows for reproducible results by making
randomization deterministic)
------------------

--- cache ---
If set to true (checked) processed dataset will be cached to speed up the
following runs of the task which uses the same dataset and parameter
configurations.

Caching is only implemented for MBA (Microbe Atlas) data. After the dataset
has been seperated into files for each sample, to work with TF dataset,
they are uploaded to coretex.
