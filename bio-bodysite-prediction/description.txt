--- Template description ---

Body site prediction project template is based on XGBoost (gradient
boosting) algorithm.

This template takes BioInformatics sequence taxonomic compositions
and traines a model which is capable of predicting body site (from which the
sample originates) based on the sample taxonomic composition.

Data provided to the model can be in either of these two formats:
    - MBA (Microbe Atlas)
    - ForBiome (Forensics Microbiome Database, maintained by Microbiome Forensics Institute Zurich)
 
Input of the model is a 2D matrix with input shape [samples, uniqueTaxons] where:
    - samples: number of samples in the dataset,
    - uniqueTaxons: number of unique taxons in the dataset

Output of the model is a 1D array with integers representing different bodysites.

Expected TaskRun runtime on CPU with ~1 GB of MBA data is ~4m 22s.
Expected TaskRun runtime on GPU with ~1 GB of MBA data is ~3m 19s.

System specifications on which the TaskRuns were run:
    - CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X Eight-Core Processor
    - GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 12 GB VRAM
    - RAM: 32 GB 2666 MHz DDR4

TaskRun parameters:
    - Percentile: 100
    - Quantize: False
    - Epochs: 100
    - Early stopping: 0
    - Cache: False
    - Enviromnment: Clean

--- Template parameters description ---

--- dataset description ---
A dataset which contains OTU abundance data. Supported dataset formats are:
    - MBA (Microbe Atlas): Dataset must contain one Coretex.ai sample
      with "samples.env.info" file, and one or more Coretex.ai samples
      which contain a single ".mapped" file (file with ".mapped" extension)
    - ForBiome (Forensics Microbiome Database, maintained by Microbiome Forensics
      Institute Zurich): Dataset must contain BioInformatics samples in json
      format as defined by "Microbiome Forensics Institute Zurich". Coretex.ai
      sample must contain only a single json file which contains data for a
      single BioInformatics sample.
---------------------------

--- validation description ---
Defines if TaskRun will be run in training or validation mode.
If the value is set to false (unchecked) training mode will run,
and if the value is set to true (checked) then validation mode will be run.

If training mode is selected following parameters must be provided:
    - dataset
    - validation (value: false)
    - datasetType
    - taxonomicLevel
    - sampleOrigin
    - percentile
    - quantize
    - sequencingTechnique
    - learningRate
    - epochs
    - earlyStopping
    - validationSplit
    - useGpu
    - cache

If validation mode is selected following parameters must be provided:
    - dataset
    - validation (value: true)
    - trainedModel
    - datasetType
    - taxonomicLevel
    - sampleOrigin
    - quantize
    - sequencingTechnique
    - cache
------------------------------

--- trainedModel description ---
Id of the model on which the validation will run.
If validation mode is selected this parameter must be provided,
and if training mode is selected this parameter will be ignored.
--------------------------------

--- datasetType description ---
Type of the provided dataset. Possible values are:
    - MBA (Microbe Atlas)
    - ForBiome (Microbiome Forensics Institute Zurich)

For more details see "dataset" parameter.
-------------------------------

--- taxonomicLevel description ---
Taxonomic level used for creating OTU (feature) tables used as
the input of the model. Expected value is a non-negative integer.

Expected values for taxon "B16S;90_3084;96_8430;97_10076":
    - Level 1: "B16S"
    - Level 2: "B16S;90_3084"
    - Level 3: "B16S;90_3084;96_8430"
----------------------------------

--- sampleOrigin description ---
Information on where sample originates from, the environment from
which the sample was collected from.

Example values are: animal, plant, aquatic, human, soil, field, etc.
--------------------------------

--- percentile description ---
Amount of features which are kept for training. Value of the parameter is
expressed in percents (%) from 1 - 100. The most representative features are kept.
------------------------------

--- quantize description ---
If set to true (checked) then lower precision (uint16 instead of int32) will
be used for storing taxon count. Setting this value to true can improve model
performance, but it can decrease model accuracy.
----------------------------

--- sequencingTechnique description ---
Sample sequencing techniques which were used to seqeuence the samples.
Possible values are:
    - AMPLICON
    - SHOTGUN
    - WGS

If value is set to "AMPLICON" then all samples which were sequenced using
that method will be used for further processing.
---------------------------------------

--- learningRate description ---
Learning rate of the gradiend boosting algorithm. Prefered range of values
is 10^-6 (0,000001) - 1.0. Higher learning rates allow model to train faster,
but at the cost of final model accuracy. Lower learning rates make
model train significantly slower, but in a more optimal manner.
--------------------------------

--- epochs description ---
Number of passes that the model will make through the dataset while
training. Higher values increase training time and accuracy, while lower
values decrease training time, but they might also decrease accuracy.
--------------------------

--- earlyStopping description ---
Defines how many consecutive epochs should pass during which the model hasn't
learned anything (loss reduction was minimal or non-existent) before the training
will stop.

After the training has stopped this way, the final model will be picked from the
last N (defined by earlyStopping value) epochs, taking the model (weights) from
the epoch which had the highest learning rate (lowest loss).
---------------------------------

--- validationSplit description ---
Percentage of dataset which will be used for validation. Prefered value range is
0.1 - 0.9, while the optimal value is 0.2. If values are close or equal to 0, or
close or equal to 1 unexpected errors can appear.

If value for "validationSplit" is 0.2, then that means that 20% of the dataset
will go for validation, while the rest (80%) will go for training.
-----------------------------------

--- useGpu ---
If set to true (checked) the GPU will be used for training, otherwise CPU
will be used.

Using GPU for training can decrease training time significantly.
--------------

--- cache ---
If set to true (checked) processed dataset will be cached to speed up the
following runs of the task which uses the same dataset and parameter
configurations.

Caching is only implemented for MBA (Microbe Atlas) data. It is done in
two steps:
    1. MBA data is loaded into python objects which are then pickled and
       uploaded to Coretex.ai as a dataset. This cache depends on
       "sampleOrigin" and "sequencingTechnique" parameters.
    2. Processed model input and output data is pickled and uploaded to
       Coretex.ai just before training has started. This cache depends on
       the same parameters as the 1st step cache, as well as "quantize" and
       "percentile" parameters
