    "description": "This job uses vsearch to perform OTU clustering with the de novo method.\n\nOTU stands for \"Operational Taxonomic Unit.\" OTU clustering involves grouping\nsimilar DNA or RNA sequences together based on a predefined sequence similarity\nthreshold. The similarity threshold is typically set at a certain percentage (e.g., 97%)\nof sequence identity. Sequences that share this level of\nsimilarity are grouped into the same OTU.\n\nThe input is the dataset created by the third job in the Coretex Qiime Pipeline,\nDADA2. What gets used for the clustering is the feature table.\n\nThe output is a BIOM file with OTUs.",
