    "description": "This job imports sequencing reads into a Qiime2 format so that, later downstream, they\ncould be processed and analysed by using other jobs that are part of the Coretex Qiime pipeline.\n\nBoth multiplexed and demultiplexed sequencing reads, as well as both single-end and paired-end\nsequencing reads are supported. Only sequences with quality, a.k.a. fastq, files can be\nimported with this job.\n\nIn the case you want to import multiplexed data, you will need it in the \"EMP protocol\",\nabout which you can learn more here: http://earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/.\nThe input should be one \"forward.fastq\" file with your sequences (or only forward sequences in\ncase you are importing paired-end reads), one \"barcodes.fastq\" which will have the\nbarcodes for each read in the file, and optionally, in case of paired-end reads, a\n\"reverse.fastq\" with the reverse sequences.\n\nIn addition to these two to three files, you also need a metadata file in either tsv or\ncsv format. The metadata should follow the qiime2 standards which can be found here:\nhttps://gregcaporaso.github.io/q2book/using/metadata.html\n\nAll your data can be uploaded as a single zip file / Coretex sample, or you may\nchoose to upload multiple, in which case each of them must follow the same protocol as\ndescribed above.\n\nIn the case you want to import demultiplexed data, you will need to have each sample\nas a separate Coretex sample with either one (single-end) or two (paired-end) fastq files.\nIn addition, a \"_metadata\" Coretex sample is required that will hold the metadata file.\nIn case you are using sequencing reads generated by an Illumina sequencing machine,\nyou can automatically import them in the needed format by using the \"Illumina dataset\"\noption when creating a Coretex dataset in a bioinformatics space.",
