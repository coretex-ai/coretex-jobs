name: 'Qiime2 -> Step 7: Alpha & Beta Diversity Analysis'
description: "Downstream analysis provides most information about the sequences.\n\
  There are two kinds of downstream analysis:\n    - Alpha diversity\n    - Beta diversity\n\
  \nAlpha diversity provides a detailed information about which bacteria are contained\
  \ inside a single sample.\nBeta diversity provides a detailed information about\
  \ regional and local diversity between samples.\n\nInput data is:\n    - File which\
  \ contains metadata about samples\n    - Filtered sequence data generated by the\
  \ third task in\n      the Coretex Qiime pipeline, DADA2\n    - Rooted sequence\
  \ tree generated by the sixth task in the\n      Coretex Qiime pipeline, Phylogenetic\
  \ Diversity Analysis\n\nOutput data is:\n    - Shannon\u2019s diversity index -\
  \ quantitative measure of community richness\n    - Observed Features - qualitative\
  \ measure of community richness\n    - Faith\u2019s Phylogenetic Diversity  - qualitative\
  \ measure of community\n      richness that incorporates phylogenetic relationships\
  \ between the features\n    - Evenness (Pielou\u2019s Evenness) - measure of community\
  \ evenness\n    - Jaccard distance - qualitative measure of community dissimilarity\n\
  \    - Bray-Curtis distance - quantitative measure of community dissimilarity\n\
  \    - unweighted UniFrac distance - qualitative measure of community\n      dissimilarity\
  \ that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features\n    - weighted\
  \ UniFrac distance - quantitative measure of community dissimilarity\n      that\
  \ incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features"
