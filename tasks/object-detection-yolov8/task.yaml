    - name: dataset
      description: A dataset which contains images and annotations which are represented\
        \ by Coretex.ai\r\nimage annotation format.
      value: 1981
      data_type: dataset
      required: true
    - name: model
      description: Coretex model used as a checkpoint for transfer learning or for validation.
        If this\nvalue is specified it is used over \"weights\" parameter.
      value: 111
      data_type: model
      required: false
  - name: outputs
    params:
    - name: outputModel
      description: Model trained by this task.
      value: null
      data_type: model
      required: false
  - name: sharedParameters
    params:
    - name: validation
      description: If the value of the this parameter is true, then only the validation of the
        provided trained model is performed. If the value of the this parameter is false,
        then a new model for object detection is trained.
      value: true
      data_type: bool
      required: true
    - name: batchSize
      description: Number of segments into which the dataset is split before the training or validating.\r\
        \nDuring the training a single epoch passes through all of the segments\r\n\
        before moving on to the next epoch. Higher values decrease training time,\r\n\
        but will increase memory consumption, while lower values increase training\r\
        \ntime, but decrease memory consumption.
      value: 16
      data_type: int
      required: true
    - name: imageSize
      description: Size to which the images from the dataset will be resized to before\
        \ training or validating.\r\nThis affects input and output shapes of the model. Input and\
        \ output image shapes\r\nwill be equal to \"imageSize * imageSize * 3\" where\
        \ imageSize represents both width\r\nand height of the image, while number 3\
        \ (RGB image) represents the number of channels.\r\n\r\nHigher values increase\
        \ training time, but they can increase model accuracy, while lower\r\nvalues\
        \ decrease training time, but they also can decrease model accuracy.
      value: 640
      data_type: int
      required: true
    - name: excludedClasses
      description: Classes which will be excluded from the dataset when the training
        or validating process starts.
      value: [document]
      data_type: list[str]
      required: false
    - name: treshold
      description: Threshold value that determines the quality of the prediction. If the
        predicted IoU score is higher than the threshold value, the prediction is good.
        If the predicted IoU score is lower than the threshold value, the
        prediction is unsatisfactory.

      required: false
    - name: epochs
      description: Number of passes that the model will make through the dataset while\r\
        \ntraining. Higher values increase training time and accuracy, while lower\r\
        \nvalues decrease training time, but they might also decrease accuracy.
      value: 100
      data_type: int
      required: true
    - name: validationSplit
      description: Percentage of dataset which will be used for validation. Prefered\
        \ value range is\r\n0.1 - 0.9, while the optimal value is 0.2. If values are\
        \ close or equal to 0, or\r\nclose or equal to 1 unexpected errors can appear.\r\
        \n\r\nIf value for \"validationSplit\" is 0.2, then that means that 20% of the\
        \ dataset\r\nwill go for validation, while the rest (80%) will go for training.
      value: 0.2
