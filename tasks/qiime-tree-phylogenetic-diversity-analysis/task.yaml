description: "To do downstream analysis you first need to generate a phylogenetic\
  \ tree representation\r\nof sequences contained in the data generated by the previous\
  \ step (\"Step #2\"). This will\r\ncreate a tree representation of all data samples\
  \ contained inside the sequence.\r\n\r\nInput data is filtered sequence data generated\
  \ by the previous step.\r\nOutput data is:\r\n    - Aligned sequence data\r\n  \
  \  - Masked aligned sequence data\r\n    - Unrooted sequence tree\r\n    - Rooted\
  \ sequence tree\r\n"
