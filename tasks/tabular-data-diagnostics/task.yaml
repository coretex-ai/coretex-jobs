    description: Hyperparameter which is defined as the longest path between the root
      node and the leaf node of a tree in Random Forest Classifier. Using the max_depth
      parameter, You can limit up to what depth You want every tree in your random
      forest to grow. This parameter influence the size of model and model accuracy.
      If there is large amount of data and model size is too large our suggestion
      is to limit max_depth parameter on a value that is less than 10.
